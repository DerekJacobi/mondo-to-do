To Do Application - Derek Jacobi

## Tech Used:
Angular, Express, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS

## Why Angular:
 1. Two-way data binding
    Angular uses two way data binding to update the model and view at the same time. When the model or view gets updated, the other reflects the change.
 2. Ability to update the page without refreshing. This is helpful for a to-do list, because we are adding and removing tasks in real time, without having to wait for a refresh of the DOM.
 3. AngularFire is an officially supported Firebase and Angular binding.  A to-do list can be saved, and viewed, instantly using a Firebase backend.  A to-do list can be updated, and edited in real time by more then one user using the power of Firebase.

## Why Express:
  Express provides a simple, lightweight, server that is up an running very quickly, with the ability to add in a lot of middleware and HTTP utility methods easily. Express works out of the box for displaying a website, without being bloated with unused middleware.  The MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) is based on Express, and uses Javascript across the stack.  This allows for a developer to know one language (JS), and build a complete, full stack, single, or multipage application with it.  Compare this to the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP), which requires a knowledge of four different languages.

## Why Bootstrap:
  Bootstrap is easy to use, looks good, is customizable (up to a point, editing specific parts of your HTML may need to be declared !important). For a project that needs a quick turn around, Bootstrap can provide a number of Javascript components such as modals, drop-downs, tool-tips and tabs, that can provide the site with a lot of functionality, without taking much time.
